=head1 NAME

lof.pl - Perl implemention for the LOF(Local Outlier Factor) algorithm.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

lof.pl k InputFile

INPUT
k:	k nearest neighbors, k>=1, k is an integer. 
	If the query point is a point of the original data file, the 1st nearest point is the query point itself.
	
	K is the minimum number of objects a "cluster" has to contain. 
	K is the maximum number of "close by" objects than can potentially be local outliers.
	The LOF paper suggests k is between 10 and 20.
	
InputFile: Each line is a point. Attributes are seperated by a space ' '. 


OUTPUT
lof.txt: Each line is a point's lof value for the input file. The higher the LOF value, the stronger the outlier.	

=head1 DESCRIPTION

LOF is a density-based outlier detection algorithm. To run lof.pl, you need the KD.pm module.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
