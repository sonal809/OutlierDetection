Revision history for Perl extension Heap::Simple.

0.13	2008-01-27 14:57:46 UT
	- No functional changes
	- Added "cover" and "ppm uninstall private make targets
	- Removed "ppm_update" private make target
	- Demand Heap::Simple::Perl 0.13 which got a workaround for a perl 5.6
	  bug

0.12	2008-01-13 16:17:30 UT
	- No functional changes
	- Removed the comment that for equal keys the code reference order is
	  free to return either true or false. That was never completely true
	  and it can confuse things like "extract_upto".
	- Small clarifications in the documentation
	- Added MANIFEST.SKIP
	- added private "ppm_install" and "ppm_update" make targets
	- Added PackageTools based versioning
	- Demand at least version 0.10 for Heap::Simple::XS
	- Stop being a flat distribution

0.11	2005-11-30
	- Fixed a missing interpolation in Makefile.PL. This only changes
	  the text shown during make and doesn't change any functionality

0.10	2005-11-20
	- Fetch required versions of Heap::Simple::XS and Heap::Simple::Perl in
          Makefile.PL, and warn about out of order upgrades
	- Updated documentation (fixes, new functionality)
	    - insert/key_insert can now take a variable number of arguments
	    - absorb/key_absorb can now take a variable number of arguments
	    - new method merge_arrays
	    - new method extract_all
        - Updated minimum version numbers of Heap::Simple::Perl and
          Heap::Simple::XS so that they support the new documented features
	- Replaced :: by - in author email address (easier quoting for mailers)

0.09  2004-11-11
	- Remove double documentation of "first"
        - Fixed email in Makefile.PL
        - Oops, required perl 5.8.4 in the Makefile.PL. Module should however
          work on any perl5
        - Updated minimum version numbers of Heap::Simple::Perl and
          Heap::Simple::XS

0.08  2004-10-25
	- Increase the version number so it's higher than the old Heap::Simple
          (which is now Heap::Simple::Perl). 0.07 was an accidental upload of
          Heap::Simple::Perl with the wrong name for the tar.gz file

0.01  2004-10-23
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X -n Heap::Simple
